      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Access Token and Refresh Token</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        An access token is a credential used to access protected resources in an API. It is usually obtained by authenticating with a server using a username and password or other authentication methods. Access tokens have a limited lifespan and are used to authorize API requests.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        A refresh token is a special type of token that can be used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-enter their credentials. It is typically used to provide long-term authentication and is exchanged for a new access token when the previous one expires.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Both access tokens and refresh tokens play a crucial role in securing API communication and managing user authentication and authorization.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the client-side, access tokens and refresh tokens should be securely stored. Access tokens are often stored in memory or local storage, allowing easy access for API requests. Refresh tokens, on the other hand, should be securely stored, preferably in an HTTP-only cookie to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting attacks.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">SQL vs. NoSQL Databases</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that organize data into tables with predefined schemas. They enforce strict data integrity and provide powerful querying capabilities through SQL.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in flexible, schema-less formats such as key-value pairs, documents, column families, or graphs. They offer horizontal scalability and flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, complexity of the queries, and the need for transactional integrity. SQL databases are often used for structured data with complex relationships, while NoSQL databases excel in handling large volumes of unstructured data and providing high scalability.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Express.js and Nest.js</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Express.js is a popular and lightweight web framework for Node.js. It provides a minimalistic approach to building web applications and APIs, offering a robust set of features for routing, middleware, request handling, and template rendering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nest.js, on the other hand, is a progressive Node.js framework built with TypeScript. It is inspired by Angular and combines elements of object-oriented programming, functional programming, and functional reactive programming. Nest.js provides a modular architecture and a set of powerful abstractions, making it suitable for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">MongoDB Aggregate</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        MongoDB Aggregate is a powerful aggregation framework provided by MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. It allows for advanced data processing and analysis by applying a series of pipeline stages to the documents in a collection.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        The aggregation pipeline consists of multiple stages, such as filtering, projecting, grouping, sorting, and transforming data. Each stage operates on the input documents and passes the results to the next stage. This allows for complex data manipulations, including aggregations, calculations, and transformations, all within the database.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The MongoDB Aggregate framework provides a flexible and efficient way to perform complex queries and analytics on large datasets, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and reporting.
